# TokoBuku-app

A full-stack ecommerce app that sell books from various authors and publishers.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a group final project at Purwadhika Coding School, I build this app with 2 of my classmates (Agfan & Giran) in 10 days and presented it at the last day. I realize that this project is far from perfect, so I will learn and practice more in the further.

Please kindly see my other projects, thank you.<br/>
